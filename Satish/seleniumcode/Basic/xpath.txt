What is XPath in Selenium (Python)?

XPath (XML Path Language) is a locator strategy used in Selenium to find elements on a web page.
It navigates through the HTML (DOM structure) of a webpage to identify elements like buttons, text boxes, links, etc.

In Selenium with Python, XPath is commonly used when:

Elements don’t have unique id or name

You need to locate elements based on text, attributes, or relationships

Basic XPath Syntax
//tagname[@attribute='value']


Types of XPath
1. Absolute XPath ❌ (Not Recommended)

Starts from the root of the HTML document.

/html/body/div[1]/form/input[2] (To get Absolute path right click on element>inspect then right click on html highlighted code >copy>copy full xpath


⚠️ Breaks easily if page structure changes.

2. Relative XPath ✅ (Recommended)

Starts from anywhere in the DOM.
Basic XPath Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute='value']
e.g.
//input[@name='password'] # Here input is a tagname and name is a attribute and password is a vale of attribute
"""

Relative Xpath Methods:
1. text() Method: This method is used to select elements based on their text content (e.g. text on button,h1,h2 tag, link etc).
   e.g. //tagname[text()='textvalue']
2.contains() Method:

Basic syntax of contains()
Attribute-based
//tagname[contains(@attribute,'partial_value')] # partial value means for e.g value is user_123_name then partial value use 'user' only

Text-based
//tagname[contains(text(),'partial_text')]
