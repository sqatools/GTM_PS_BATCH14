# Copilot / AI agent instructions

This repository is a collection of small, individual Python example projects organized per contributor (top-level folders like `Swital`, `Anshika`, `Deepesh`, etc.). There is no single application, build system, or test harness — treat this as a student-exercises workspace.

Goals for AI edits
- Prefer read-only analysis first: open files under each contributor folder to understand intent before changing code.
- Do not bulk-modify many contributors' files without an explicit PR and a clear rationale.

Repository characteristics (quick summary)
- Structure: Many top-level folders are personal exercise collections (e.g. [Swital/Python_BasicProg_Practise/AI_integrate_understand](Swital/Python_BasicProg_Practise/AI_integrate_understand)).
- Most files are single-file Python scripts (`First_program.py`, `first_program.py`, `first_file.py`), plain text, or short exercises.
- No CI, package manifests, or centralized tests were found in the repository root (see [README.md](README.md)).

How to be productive here (concrete, project-specific guidance)
- To run an example on Windows, use: `python path\\to\\script.py` from the workspace root.
- Debugging: use `python -m pdb path\\to\\script.py` or VS Code Run/Debug for a single file.
- If you find identical improvements across many personal folders (typo fixes, README updates), prefer proposing a single PR that documents the change and lists affected user folders.

Patterns and conventions discovered
- Filenames vary in case and style (`First_program.py` vs `first_program.py`). Match existing casing when editing to avoid creating duplicates.
- Many scripts assume no external packages; changes that add dependencies must include an explicit note and a minimal `requirements.txt` in the repo root.

Safe-edit checklist (apply before committing changes)
- Confirm the intent of the target file by reading its first ~20 lines and nearby files in the same folder.
- Avoid changing student answers or removing content marked as an assignment unless asked.
- For any formatting or linting changes, target only one folder at a time and include a short PR description.

Examples to reference in PRs or suggestions
- Simple run example: `python Swital\\first_program.py` (adjust path to the actual file name).
- Suggested documentation target: [README.md](README.md) — add a one-line repo description if you modify high-level documentation.

If you find an existing AI guidance file
- Merge instead of overwrite: preserve any hand-authored instructions and extend them with discovered facts above.

When to escalate to the repo owner
- Large-scale automated refactors, dependency additions, or changes that affect many personal folders.

Questions? After this addition, ask the maintainer which contributor folders are safe to modify and whether they prefer a single aggregate PR or many small ones.
