"""This module demonstrates the use of class methods in Python OOP.
# instance method: (self)
A method that operates on an instance of the class. 
It takes 'self' as the first parameter and can access instance variables and other instance methods.        

# classmethod:(cls)
A method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes 'cls' as 
the first parameter and can access class variables and other class methods.

# staticmethod:   no self or cls          
A method that does not take 'self' or 'cls' as the first parameter. 
It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.
